# CS203-group-activity--1

Write a Java program (based on a graph traversal algorithm you've learned in this class) that, for a given undirected graph, outputs: the vertices of each connected component. Your programs should take inputs from a file via the command line (or by asking the user to provide the file name) with the following structure in the input file. Each line of the input file represents a graph. The first number in a line specifies the number of vertices in the graph. Then pairs of vertices define the edges. 


Write a Java program that implements k-selection. • The input is an unsorted array of length n. • Find the value in the array that would be on position k if the array were sorted. You should not sort the array to find the position of k. • For example, in the figure below, the number 5 is on position 4. Thus, for k=4, find the number that is on position 4; the result is 5.
